## About Me

Hi! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). <!--I am mentored by [Hehui Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vGY9WiEAAAAJ&hl=en).-->

Before returning to my alma mater Fudan, I received my PhD degree in [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO)](https://aco.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Anton Bernshteyn](https://bahtoh-math.github.io/). Here's my [Math Genealogy entry](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=321109).

My hometown is [Dongtai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongtai).

## Contact Me

* Email: [jyu@fudan.edu.cn](mailto:jyu@fudan.edu.cn)
  
* Office: Room 339, Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, 2005 Songhu Road, Shanghai, China

## Research Interest

My main areas of research are combinatorics and descriptive set theory.  Some particular topics I am interested in : probabilistic methods in descriptive combinatorics, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, distributed algorithms.
